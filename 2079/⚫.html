        <p>Humanity has made significant advancements in technological, medical and scientific development. We had self-driving high-ways with road fatalities dropping to almost zero; our banks had adopted a blockchain-powered economy, with cash going extinct; no more infectious diseases, with auto-doc systems we had near perfect health. Environmental stability was no longer a concern. We seemed to have had it all figured out. With most of the problems out of the way, we had more time to focus on other different matters, but we had no way to know what was coming.</p>
        <p>In year 2079 everything has changed. They identified themselves as Viratu. No one knows how they've arrived or why. We didn't know if we were being invaded, investigated or saved. Any attempts on establishing contact were in vain. We couldn't fight them either. Viratu never communicated with any of humans directly. Select few people describe seeing visions in their eyes, and hearing voices in their heads that issued orders, all of this in a way so natural, that it all seemed like our own ideas. They were the chosen ones, a bridge between Viratu and humanity. Stodins. When they spoke, we had no choice but to hear them.</p>
        <p>Then we started to build. Our machinery was repurposed, artificial intelligence reprogrammed and most of the development for our own purposes stopped. We knew what we were building, that it will eventually our tomb, but we couldn't resist, something was blocking our hatred for our masters, our hesitation, and fuelled us to carry out the works for them. Viratu knew how our emotions worked and had a way to manipulate them.</p>
        <p>What we have built was a vast network of underground hibernation pods that could preserve human life. Each farm had thousands of pods, each country had built tens of thousands of farms on their soil, and programmed millions of mechanical drone-workers to maintain them. The entire network was interconnected, and at served a single purpose. Hypernation.</p>
        <p>The entire population—through voices of our own kind—was offered a choice to either continue our existence by being placed into one of these pods or to die. Life in a pod would emerge our mind and body into a simulation of our world before 2020, naturally with all of our memories cleaned out. We would then continue our lives as we would. The pods function as life support, so our bodies will not degrade over time, as fast as they would have if we used them normally, and will require no external maintenance while we're connected to the network.</p>
        <p>We didn't have time to think, but this time nothing was influencing our minds to make the choice. This time our faith was in our hands. Having not much of a choice to make, most have agreed immediately, and close to 9.5 billion people have been placed into the hypernation. Some have panicked and tried to run away, or reason what it would mean to humanity's true right to live. Each and every one who had hesitated to give the answer in one way or another were killed. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were just dropping dead for others to witness. There was no turning back, the choice was made for them now.</p>
        <p>Select few remain in the real world now. Those who are called Stodins, 62 people that live alongside Viratu, that serve as a link between them and hyper-humanity, live in the world that is yet again untouched and desolate. Several other souls roam this world in wonder, in question, or in fear. Why were they left alive? Why didn't they need to chose? Are they special?</p>
