          We used Raspberry Pi with a microphone attached to the ping pong table to record ping pong ball bounces. Audio streams are analysed to measure the amplitude and the length of each individual bounce. Data is used to report on unbroken bounce streak and longevity of the game. The longest game streak, total streaks and the table availability are displayed on the dashboard. Table availability is shown, with an option to send an SMS to the number to get a notification when the table becomes available. Collaboration work for Nexmo Internal IOT Hackathon.
