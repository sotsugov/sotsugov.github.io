        <p>Humanity has made significant advancements in technological, medical and scientific development. We had self-driving high-ways with road fatalities dropping to almost zero; our banks had adopted a blockchain-powered economy, with cash going extinct; no more infectious diseases, with auto-doc systems we had near perfect health, environmental stability was no longer a concern. It has been a while since we had a war. We seemed to have had most of it figured out. We had time to focus on things that matter, but we had no way to know what was coming. </p>
        <p>In the year 2079 everything has changed. We started seeing strange shapes suspended in the air, they were human-like but far bigger, their bodies covered in symbols we couldn't read, numerous wires dangling from their backs. Long arms always loose around their slim bodies. Hundreds of shrapnel pieces slowly revolving in the air where their heads should be. No one knows how they've arrived at Earth or why. We didn't know if we were being invaded, investigated or saved. Any attempts on establishing contact were in vain. We were unable to attack them either. What we've felt we could not identify. They never communicated with any of us directly. They chose representatives. Those who were selected describe seeing visions in their eyes and hearing voices that issued commands, all of this in a way so natural, that it all seemed like thoughts of our own. These people were the chosen ones, a bridge between them and humanity. Stodins. When they spoke, we had no choice but to hear them.</p>
        <p>Then we started to build. Everyone dropped what they were doing. Our machinery was repurposed, artificial intelligence reprogrammed and most of the development was focused on a single common goal. We knew what we were building, that it will eventually our tomb, but we couldn't resist, something was blocking our hatred for our masters, our hesitation, and fuelled us to carry out the works for them. They knew how our emotions worked and had a way to manipulate them. </p>
        <p>What we have built was a vast network of underground hibernation pods that could preserve human life. Each farm had thousands of pods, each country had built tens of thousands of farms on their soil, and programmed millions of drone-workers to maintain them. The entire network was interconnected, and it served a single purpose. Hypernation.</p>
        <p>The entire population—through voices of stodins—was offered a choice to either continue our existence by being placed into one of these pods or to die. Life in a pod would emerge our mind and body into a simulation of our world before 2020. We would then continue our lives without even noticing a difference. The pods function as life support, so our bodies will not degrade over time, as fast as they would have if we used them normally, and will require no external maintenance while we're connected to the network. But we would lose all of our memories. </p>
        <p>We didn't have time to think, but this time nothing was influencing our minds to make the choice. This time our faith was in our hands. Having not much of a choice to make, most have agreed immediately, and close to 9.5 billion people have been placed into the hypernation. They did not discriminate, women, children, elderly, it didn't matter to them. There were no exceptions. Some have panicked and tried to run away, or reason what it would mean to humanity's true right to live, or resist having to chose. Each and everyone who had hesitated to give the answer in one way or another were killed. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were just dropping dead without any visible damage to them, for others to witness. After this there was no turning back, the choice was made for them now. </p>
        <p>Now only 62 people remain in the world that is yet again barren and desolate. I was one of them, roaming around in wonder, in fear, and in question. Why were we left alive? Why didn't we need to chose? Are we special?</p>    </div>
